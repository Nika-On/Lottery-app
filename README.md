##Lottery App
This is a simple lottery app that lets you choose numbers from 1 to 30 and then notifies you if you won or not. You can also see how many numbers you matched and play again with the reset feature.

##How to use
Open the app in your browser.
You will see a grid of 30 numbers. Click on any six numbers to select them. You can change your selection by clicking on the same number again.
Once you have selected six numbers, click on the “Check” button to see the result.
The app will generate six random numbers and compare them with your selection. If you matched all six numbers, you will see a message saying “You won!”. If you matched some but not all numbers, you will see a message saying “You matched X numbers” where X is the number of matches. If you matched none of the numbers, you will see a message saying “You lost”.
You can play again by clicking on the “Reset” button. This will clear your selection and select new random numbers.
